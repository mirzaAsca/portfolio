            ABOUT ME
            <br />
            Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm currently a junior developer.
            However, don't let that fool you. Feel free to click around and
            explore a mere 2% of my potential that's showcased here! <br></br>{" "}
            <br></br>My skillset spans across both front-end and back-end
            technologies, complemented by a robust understanding of UI/UX design
            principles. I've had the opportunity to work on a range of projects,
            from e-commerce sites to automation tools and engaging visual
            experiences. My thirst for knowledge keeps me in pursuit of the
            latest trends in areas like Machine Learning and Artificial
            Intelligence. I am at ease with learning new technologies and taking
            the lead, as I find growth in environments that push my boundaries.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>GOING BEYOND CODING<br></br>With a diverse background that
            includes 9 years in telecommunications, 5 years in both manual and
            algorithmic trading, and a lifelong immersion in digital marketing,
            photo/video editing, and copywriting, I bring a unique perspective
            to the table. My experience as an e-commerce store owner on Shopify
            for the past 4 successful years has provided me with invaluable
            insights into a variety of markets and niches. This has only fueled
            my passion for learning and sharing knowledge. As a natural
            extrovert, I find my stride in team environments, where I can
            contribute to a common goal. I am a firm believer in the power of
            collaboration and its ability to produce synergistic outcomes.{" "}
